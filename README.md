# MNIST

I am using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify the MNIST dataset.
My 3 notebooks are Default.ipynb, Tensorflowcpu.ipynb, tensorflowgpu.ipynb.
Default.ipynb: First notebook I've done. I just looked at the input.
Tensorflowcpu.ipynb: Second notebook I've done. I am using CNNs with Keras-TensoFlow in the CPU mode.
Tensorflowcpu.ipynb: Third notebook I've done. I am using my GPU to be faster. The most recent model of CNNs I used are there.
